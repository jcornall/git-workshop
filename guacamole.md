# Classic Guacamole

## Ingredients

- 3 ripe avocados
- 1 lime, juiced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup diced red onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 Roma tomatoes, diced
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 pinch ground cayenne pepper (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the avocados**: Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit, and
   scoop the flesh into a medium bowl.
2. **Mash the avocados**: Using a fork or potato masher, gently mash the
   avocados to your desired consistency (smooth or slightly chunky).
3. **Add lime juice**: Immediately add the lime juice and mix well to
   prevent browning.
4. **Season**: Stir in the salt, garlic, and cayenne pepper (if using).
5. **Fold in vegetables**: Gently fold in the diced red onion, tomatoes, and
   cilantro.
6. **Taste and adjust**: Season with additional salt or lime juice as
   needed.
7. **Serve**: Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with additional
   cilantro if desired. Serve immediately with tortilla chips or as a
   topping for your favorite Mexican dishes.

## Tips

- For best results, use ripe avocados that yield slightly to gentle
  pressure.
- To prevent browning, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the
  guacamole if storing.
- Guacamole is best enjoyed fresh but can be refrigerated for up to 1 day.
